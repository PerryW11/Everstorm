# What is Everstorm?

As my current work in progress, Everstorm is a first person shooter with characters that possess different abilities. It currently contains a quest system, zombie AI, a fully functional character, and more. This is a work in progress, but one I work on nearly every day. Thanks for stopping by!

# Characters

Currently working on: Aido

Aido, an inter-galactic soldier from the planet Gronda, is tasked with cleansing the universe of all infection. 

Aido is equipped with a tri-burst laser rifle, impulse bomb launcher, and armor for sprinting and air control capabilities. Suitable for "cleansing" purposes.

Primary: Tri-burst laser rifle - each shot does 20 damage, magazine capacity of 15.

Secondary: Impulse bomb - does 100 damage, 8 second cooldown

Utility: Sprint - unlimited

## COMING NEXT

Kalonymus, demon warrior from the hell clan Ulphram, sent to eradicate all souls that escaped hell and those who stand in his way.

Primary: Searing Flame - closest target within cone spread receives a fire implosion, taking 30 initial damage, and 18 burning damage every second for 5 seconds - 2 second cooldown

Secondary: Fiery Visage - spawn a flame portal that locks onto maximum of 3 nearby enemies and fire rays of flame at them, burning them for 5 damage every half second - 12 second cooldown

Utility: Deadlock - swaps locations with an enemy and leaves the mark of Ulphram on the Kalonymus's original locaiton, draining health on those who stand on it, dealing 5 damage a second and healing Kalonymus for 1

# Objectives

The player will be a given a task to complete depending on the various levels. Dying will result in failure.

FIRST QUEST: Collect all the crystals and return them to Targoroth (NPC in game)

SECOND QUEST: Eliminate all zombies in the area

This project is being made with the Unreal Engine using C++ and blueprints.
