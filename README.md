# What is Everstorm?

As my current work in progress, Everstorm is a first person shooter with characters that possess different abilities. 

# Characters

Currently working on: Aido

Aido, an inter-galactic soldier from the planet Gronda, is tasked with cleansing the universe of all infection. 

Aido is equipped with a tri-burst laser rifle, impulse bomb launcher, and armor for sprinting and air control capabilities. Suitable for "cleansing" purposes.

Primary: Tri-burst laser rifle - each shot does 20 damage, magazine capacity of 15.

Secondary: Impulse bomb - does 100 damage, 5 second cooldown

Utility: Sprint - unlimited, jump (every character will be able to jump)

# Objectives

The player will be a given a task to complete depending on the various levels. Dying will result in failure.

FIRST LEVEL: The player must eliminate all zombies and get to the bridge.

This project is being made with the Unreal Engine using C++ and blueprints.
